	 * 
	 * ALLOW FILTERING requires the whole table to be read and then goes on to filter out the  invalid records. 
	 * Cassandraâ€™s read speed comes from querying the partition and clustering columns and using an index to locate 
	 * the partition data allowing them to be read without needing to read through the whole table.
